Classes Game, GameLevel, Tile, Troop, UI and Action added.
Everything necessary for the operation of the GUI is implemented in them.

I have tested the methods while I have implemented them. I haven't done thorough testing yet,
as interactions between classes aren't very complex at the moment.

No difficult errors have occurred yet.

The amount of work has been about 25 hours, and I'm on pace with the project plan at the moment.

The project hasn't progressed, because I was on a trip for a week, and
I have been busy with other school work.

3.4
The project still hasn't progressed as I have been extremely busy with school work.
I barely have any school work this and next week, so the plan is to finish the project then.
