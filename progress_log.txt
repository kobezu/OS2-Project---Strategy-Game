Classes Game, GameLevel, Tile, Troop, UI and Action added.
Everything necessary for the operation of the GUI is implemented in them.

I have tested the methods while I have implemented them. I haven't done thorough testing yet,
as interactions between classes aren't very complex at the moment.

No difficult errors have occurred yet.

The amount of work has been about 25 hours, and I'm on pace with the project plan at the moment.
